We investigate in silico molecular docking of 10 ligands relevant to wine tannins with 27 bitter taste receptors TAS2R. A 3D superimposition analysis using TAS2R38 as the reference reveals that the majority of the remaining TAS2R proteins exhibited deviations from the reference structure within the 2-3 Å range indicating moderate conformational shifts among them. We identify the protein-ligand binding site at the extracellular part and study docking with the ligands associated with bitterness in wine tannins. Rigid-flexible molecular docking unveils the protein-ligand binding affinities below the standard energy threshold (ΔG < -6.0 kcal/mol) for catechin, epicatechin, and flavan-3-ol with a standard deviation of ±0.5 kcal/mol or less. These three ligands are relevant to wine's bitter taste. The Principal Component Analysis determined the optimal mean number of clusters (n = 3). As a result, the TAS2R proteins are categorized into three distinct clusters based on their similarities to bind the bitter ligands. This suggests that bitter taste form a 2D space.
